												<h3>Damorquis</h3>
												<h4>Daniel Morkisch <br>Germany</h4>
												<p>As a huge Witcher series fan Damorquis was with great anticipation looking forward to Gwent. In no time, he dropped Hearthstone for Gwent and didn't look back ever since. The way skill is rewarded and mistakes are punished in the game, that’s what makes Gwent so attractive. Currently he is managing Team Aretuza with Hennotje forming a hopefully huge part of the Gwent community. In real life he works as a behavioural economist. Game and decision theory skills give him the edge to consistently score top 100 over several seasons.<span> <a href="#" class="icon alt fa fa-twitter"></a> <a href="#" class="icon alt fa fa-twitch"></a> </span></p>

												<h3>Hennotje</h3>
												<h4>Henno de Baar<br>Netherlands</h4>
												<p>Henno is the founder of team Aretuza and a lover of collectable card games. He gets the most joy out of building unusual or weaker decks and trying to make them work. He is a social worker in real life, and enjoys managing the social aspects of Team Aretuza. Henno is a decent Gwent player, at least that’s what he says when you ask him. His goal in Gwent is to make Team Aretuza as successful as possible<span> <a href="#" class="icon alt fa fa-twitter"></a> <a href="#" class="icon alt fa fa-twitch"></a> </span></p>

												<h3>Danman223</h3>
												<h4>Daniel Kruželák<br>Slovakia</h4>
												<p>Currently, Danman223 is working on his degree in Philosophy and also at the same time fully focused on Gwent! Before Gwent, he never really got into competitive gaming. However, he used to play almost every CCG known to man as well as MOBAs and RPGs. He started playing the game shortly after Closed beta and immediately fell in love with it. After one week of playing he reached top 100 with Eredin (god bless CB weather) and ever since he remained a constant name at the top of the ladder. Throughout the seasons he participated in several community tournaments and I won a couple of them, too.<span> <a href="#" class="icon alt fa fa-twitter"></a> <a href="#" class="icon alt fa fa-twitch"></a> </span></p>

												<h3>Aindywand</h3>
												<h4>Ilias Karamanis <br>Germany</h4>
												<p>Aindywand has been playing Gwent since the Closed Beta, more precisely right after the addition of Nilfgaard. After playing Hearthstone to quite a competitive degree, he was looking for a new CCG to eventually to compete in. What he loves about Gwent is that it is complex. Unlike other CGGs the game is hardly categorized in a few strategies like control or. One may need a different mind set for each other deck, which is quite refreshing. Recently he committed the majority of his time to become as competitive as he can get. Thus, he will be playing a lot of Gwent in the upcoming season and together with Team Aretuza and will aim for the next big event after his stage premiere in GwentSlam 2.<span> <a href="#" class="icon alt fa fa-twitter"></a> <a href="#" class="icon alt fa fa-twitch"></a> </span></p>

												<h3>Shinmiri2</h3>
												<h4>Henry Fang<br>USA</h4>
												<p>Shinmiri2 has been playing Gwent since Closed Beta and consistently finished top 500 ranked ladder as well as top 200 pro ladder. His favourite thing about Gwent is how you can almost always pinpoint the reason or misplay that caused you to win or lose a game, which is vital to improving. He loved playing competitive strategy games all of his life. Before Gwent he used to be a top-tier Dota1 player and has played on teams such as Meet Your Makers and compLexity.<span> <a href="#" class="icon alt fa fa-twitter"></a> <a href="#" class="icon alt fa fa-twitch"></a> </span></p>

												<h4>Enes Kristo <br>USA</h4>
												<p>AGlutenSnake joined Gwent in July, albeit having no CCG or card game experience. He was looking for something to pass some time with, and found an amazing game. Somehow he managed to get GM in season 1 and then kept getting better and better, especially thanks to Team Aretuza and its support. His favourite faction is Monsters and his favourite card is Woodland Spirit. <span> <a href="#" class="icon alt fa fa-twitter"></a> <a href="#" class="icon alt fa fa-twitch"></a> </span></p>

												<h4>András Kovács<br>Hungary</h4>
												<p>After having a long history with several other CCGs, Kaptain has finally found the right one for him. As currently he is changing universities, he has plenty of time to fulfill his dream and make a name of himself in the pro scene of Gwent.  As a proud man of the tree people he shall drive the apemen into the sea!<span> <a href="#" class="icon alt fa fa-twitter"></a> <a href="#" class="icon alt fa fa-twitch"></a> </span></p>

												<h3>Gvuardya</h3>
												<h4>Jonas Stoberock <br>Germany</h4>
												<p>His CCG career began with Hearthstone. He played it a lot and on a high level, but always on a casual basis. First he dipped into Gwent back in closed beta, but started playing regularly when open beta came out. He mainly focuses on his job as a university student, but at the same time tries to play as competitively as possible. He likes tournaments much more than ladder play, because building a line-up involves not only using three or four good decks, but you need a macro strategy aswell. Currently he is not streaming, but you might find him co-operating with one of his teammates on their channels sometimes.<span> <a href="#" class="icon alt fa fa-twitter"></a> <a href="#" class="icon alt fa fa-twitch"></a> </span></p>

												<h3>MrMax71</h3>
												<h4>Maxim Hönig <br>Czech Republic</h4>
												<p>MrMax71 is 16-year-old player who has been interested in videogames and cardgames since I he was a small child. Also, as a big fan of Witcher universe he loved Gwent in Witcher 3. In January 2017 he got access to the closed beta of Gwent:The Witcher cardgame and I has been playing daily since then. You can regularly find him in top 100 of the Ladder/Pro ladder. Besides that, MrMax71 is the Team Aretuza tournament winning machine. Having won numerous online tournaments such as GwentMania #12 or Gwent Speed Cup #15,#16 & #20, he is the most successful Gwent player on strivewire, officially ranked number 1.<span> <a href="#" class="icon alt fa fa-twitter"></a> <a href="#" class="icon alt fa fa-twitch"></a> </span></p>

												<h3>MacLogan_Gwent </h3>
												<h4>Jonathan Silvestre<br>France</h4>
												<p>Logan loved card games already when he was young like Pokémon, yu-gi-oh and many more. After having played a little bit of HS without any competitive intention, Gwent in Witcher 3 gave Logan a new interest of card game, and he was as motivated as he was before with Triple Triad. Sometime after he finished the Witcher 3 a Facebook ad told him about closed beta Gwent, and since then he played a billion games. He managed to win a few French tournaments and was finalist of other international tournaments. His goal now is to qualify for one of the huge tournaments by performing well on pro ladder or qualifier.<span> <a href="#" class="icon alt fa fa-twitter"></a> <a href="#" class="icon alt fa fa-twitch"></a> </span></p>

												<h3>MathiasEE</h3>
												<h4>Mathias Eller <br>Denmark</h4>
												<p>His CCG-career started with Magic the Gathering, when he broke his leg in 2013, and a friend introduced him to the game. Very competitive by nature the game basically took over all his weekends. Later he transitioned into Hearthstone, and was then dragged to the Gwent by Lifecoach. His focus for Gwent is almost exclusively the competition, even though he appreciates the great artwork and can understand why people like the Lore it is simply not his motivation. He lives in Denmark, where he works with real estate investments.<span> <a href="#" class="icon alt fa fa-twitter"></a> <a href="#" class="icon alt fa fa-twitch"></a> </span></p>

												<h3>Necrosis678</h3>
												<h4>Craig Lockyer <br>United Kingdom</h4>
												<p>Necrosis originally started playing Gwent just after the Nilfgaard update in closed beta. The tactical play being far superior to Hearthstone’s RNG heavy system, that’s what convinced him to switch over to Gwent and he never looked back. Since starting playing gwent he competed in several Good gaming tournaments, and came 4th in Gwentlemen Open. Other that Gwent he enjoys playing a wide variety of games, from Total War to Xcom to Dragon Age. His favourite game of all time (aside from Gwent) would probably be Rome total war 1.<span> <a href="#" class="icon alt fa fa-twitter"></a> <a href="#" class="icon alt fa fa-twitch"></a> </span></p>

												<h4>Mateusz Wieckowski  <br>Poland</h4>
												<p>Gwent is his first card game, nevertheless he succeeds. He started playing gwent in CBT and has finished second ranked season at 4th place. He plays a lot on pro ladder, but his main goal is to qualify to official LAN tournaments and achieve high place. <span> <a href="#" class="icon alt fa fa-twitter"></a> <a href="#" class="icon alt fa fa-twitch"></a> </span></p>

												<h3>Nocryingok</h3>
												<h4>Pedro Ricci  <br>Brazil</h4>
												<p>Nocryingok moved from online Poker to Gwent about 6 months ago. He thinks both are quite similar, but the latter's field of competitors is softer since people don't take it as seriously. His aspiration is to be a professional Gwent player, and that by that he means following the footsteps that lead you to becoming one of the best not because of your intelligence, but because of your habits<span> <a href="#" class="icon alt fa fa-twitter"></a> <a href="#" class="icon alt fa fa-twitch"></a> </span></p>
